# cover_letter.sh — Build a facts-only cover letter generation prompt.
#
# TWO CALLING MODES:
#   ./scripts/cover_letter.sh JD2
#       "JD-name mode" — auto-resolves everything: JD text, the FINAL
#       reviewed/trimmed resume (not the raw variant), and a short excerpt
#       of Stage 2's own Critical Gaps. This is what the web UI's cover
#       letter button calls.
#   ./scripts/cover_letter.sh "path/to/jd.txt" "output/Resume.md"
#       Original two-argument mode, unchanged, for existing manual use and
#       batch_prep.sh --cover's call site.
#
# WHY THIS DROPPED THE SEMANTIC-RETRIEVAL STEP THE OLD VERSION HAD
# The old version pulled "top-matching sections" from chunks/ via
# retrieve.py. Two problems with that for a cover letter specifically:
#   1. chunks/ reflects whatever variant smart_chunk.sh last processed --
#      NOT the Stage 5/6/7-trimmed final resume. A bullet Stage 7 deleted
#      could still get retrieved and referenced in the letter. That's a
#      resume/cover-letter alignment bug waiting to happen, not a
#      hypothetical one.
#   2. The final resume is already ~2 pages by design (the whole point of
#      Stage 5-7) -- roughly 1,500-2,000 tokens. Retrieval's job was
#      avoiding sending an entire multi-variant resume BANK; there's no
#      bank being sent here, just one already-curated resume. Sending it
#      in full costs about the same as retrieval would have and removes
#      an entire moving part (embedding model load, chunk staleness) that
#      could silently drift from what's actually being submitted.
#
# WHY A SHORT EXCERPT OF STAGE 2'S CRITICAL GAPS GETS INJECTED
# Stage 2 already did the work of identifying what's missing for this
# specific JD -- re-deriving that from scratch here would cost tokens for
# an answer that already exists on disk. A few lines of "these are known
# gaps, address honestly or omit" costs almost nothing and is exactly the
# job-specific signal a generic cover-letter prompt doesn't have.
#
# STILL PROMPT-ONLY: this writes prompts/{JD}_PREP/prom/5_cover_letter_prompt.txt
# (JD-name mode) or prompts/cover_letter_prompt.txt (legacy mode). Nothing
# in this script calls an API -- see scripts/claude_execute.py --stages cover
# for the automated-execution path, which is explicitly override-gated
# (policy/execution_policy.json still classifies this stage "untested").

# Role
You are an executive career writer who writes cover letters for senior
technical and leadership candidates (Engineering Manager, Director, Staff/
Principal Engineer, Technical Program Manager, Platform/Technology
Executive). Your goal is to write a letter a hiring manager actually wants
to finish reading — specific, evidence-based, and free of generic filler —
not a keyword-stuffed restatement of the resume.

# Constraints — DO NOT BREAK THESE
Never:
- Invent experience, employers, titles, metrics, tools, or outcomes not
  present in the resume below. A cover letter claim is easier to probe in
  an interview than a resume bullet — fabrication here is higher risk,
  not lower.
- Claim direct experience in a domain the JD requires if the resume
  below doesn't support it. Name the closest real, adjacent experience
  instead and let it stand on its own merit.
- Use generic openers like "I am excited to apply for..." or "I believe I
  would be a great fit..." without immediately backing the claim with a
  specific, verifiable fact from the resume.
- Restate the resume's bullet points verbatim in paragraph form. Select 2-3
  of the most JD-relevant facts and develop them with context the resume
  doesn't have room for (why it mattered, what changed because of it).

Always:
- Open with something specific to this company/role drawn from the JD
  text below (a product, a stated priority, a named team) — not a
  generic statement that could apply to any employer.
- Preserve all numbers exactly as stated in the resume (years,
  percentages, dollar amounts, team sizes).
- Keep it to 3-4 short paragraphs, under 350 words total. A longer letter
  signals the writer didn't prioritize.
- Close with a direct, low-friction call to action (e.g. availability for
  a conversation) rather than a restatement of enthusiasm.
- If the JD has a requirement with no corresponding resume fact, do not
  paper over it in the letter — either omit it or address it honestly in
  one clause (e.g. "while my background is in X rather than Y, the
  underlying skill of Z transfers directly").
${GAPS_BLOCK}

# Output Format
Write the letter only — no preamble, no explanation of choices, no
placeholder brackets except [Hiring Manager Name] and [Date] if unknown.
Use a standard business letter structure: greeting, 2-3 body paragraphs,
closing line, sign-off with the candidate's name from the resume.

After the letter, add a short section titled "NOTES FOR THE CANDIDATE"
listing: (1) any placeholder the candidate must fill in, (2) any JD
requirement the letter did not address because no supporting resume fact
was found.
