# ats_recommend.sh — Stage 3 of the multi-variant ATS workflow.
#
# Takes a JD and a VARIANT NAME, and produces a prompt that maps
# recommended edits to SPECIFIC chunk files belonging ONLY to that
# variant — rather than vague prose suggestions, and rather than
# accidentally mixing chunks from multiple resumes.
#
# WHY THE VARIANT NAME IS REQUIRED (not optional):
# A real run showed chunks/ can end up containing chunks from ALL 19
# variants at once (e.g. if smart_chunk.sh was ever run against
# output/resume/*.md directly, or multiple variants were copied to
# output/ without clearing between runs). Earlier versions of this
# script blindly globbed chunks/*.md, which — when that happens —
# silently mixes unrelated resumes into one "recommendation" prompt
# with no warning. Requiring an explicit variant name and verifying
# EXACTLY ONE variant matches it closes that failure mode instead of
# relying on manual discipline to never let it happen.
#
# IMPORTANT — fit-awareness: this script only proposes PARAPHRASE edits.
# If Stage 0 (variant_rank.sh) found POOR FIT for the JD you're running
# this against, paraphrasing chunk text will not close that gap — a
# structural domain/sector mismatch isn't fixable by wording. Run this
# only after Stage 0/1 found GOOD FIT or PARTIAL FIT, on the variant
# Stage 1 identified as the top pick.
#
# Workflow (per project convention — manual variant selection):
#   1. ./scripts/variant_rank.sh "<jd>" "output/resume"   → Stage 0/1: fit
#      gate + ranking. STOP here if Stage 0 = POOR FIT.
#   2. ./scripts/prepare_variant.sh "output/resume/<chosen>.md" "output/<jd>.md"
#      → clears output/ down to ONLY the chosen variant + JD (archives
#      everything else to output/_archive/, doesn't delete). This step
#      exists because smart_chunk.sh chunks EVERY .md file in output/ —
#      skipping this step is what caused chunks/ to end up with 20+ mixed
#      variants in a real run.
#   3. ./scripts/smart_chunk.sh                            → chunks it
#   4. ./scripts/ats_optimize.sh "<jd>" "output/<variant>.md"  → Stage 2 score
#   5. ./scripts/ats_recommend.sh "<jd>" "<variant_name>"  → Stage 3 (this)
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/ats_recommend.sh "path/to/jd.txt" "TPM_grow_therapy"
#   ./scripts/ats_recommend.sh "Senior TPM role requiring..." "TPM_grow_therapy"
#
# <variant_name> should be a substring unique to your chosen variant's
# chunk filenames (e.g. the part after "Nanditha_Murthy_Resume_" and
# before "_part_N.md"). Run with no second argument to see what variant
# names are currently detectable in chunks/.

# Role
You are continuing an ATS resume evaluation. In a prior pass, this resume
was scored against the job description below (ATS Match, Technical
Alignment, Leadership Alignment, Domain Alignment, gaps, missing
keywords) and the resume bank was already gated for fundamental fit
(domain/sector/stakeholder type) — this step assumes that gate passed.
Your job now is narrower and more concrete: turn remaining findings into
file-level, line-level edit instructions for this ONE chosen variant
(${MATCHED_DISTINCT_VARIANTS}).

# Boundary — what paraphrasing CAN and CANNOT fix
Paraphrasing can close PRESENTATION gaps: a real fact exists in the
resume but isn't phrased in the JD's terminology, isn't emphasized, or is
buried. Paraphrasing CANNOT close STRUCTURAL gaps: the JD requires a
type of experience (a sector, a stakeholder type, a scale of
responsibility, a credential) that has no genuine counterpart anywhere
in the chunks below. If you encounter a structural gap while doing this
task, do not stretch a loosely-related chunk to cover it — name it under
"GAPS — NO MATCHING CHUNK" instead. Stretching a chunk to imply
experience that isn't there is worse than leaving the gap visible,
because it sets up a claim the candidate can't actually back up in an
interview.

# Task
For each recommendation you would make to improve this resume's match to
the JD:
1. Identify the SPECIFIC chunk file (from the inventory below) that
   contains the relevant section.
2. Quote the exact current text from that file.
3. Propose a minimal paraphrase — reword/reorder/re-emphasize using the
   JD's terminology where the underlying fact genuinely matches. Do not
   add any skill, tool, metric, employer, or outcome not already present
   in that chunk.
4. If a JD requirement has no corresponding fact in ANY chunk below, say
   so explicitly under "GAPS — NO MATCHING CHUNK" rather than inventing
   one or forcing a weak chunk to stand in for it.

# Constraints — DO NOT BREAK THESE
- Every edit must cite the exact filename it applies to.
- Every edit must preserve all numbers exactly (years, percentages,
  dollar amounts, team sizes).
- Minimal paraphrase only — this is not a rewrite-everything pass. If a
  chunk already matches the JD's language well, say so and leave it alone
  rather than changing it for the sake of changing it.
- Do not propose a paraphrase for a structural gap (see Boundary above).
  A reworded sentence that implies experience the candidate doesn't have
  is a worse outcome than an honestly named gap.

# Output Format

## Edits by File
For each chunk file that needs a change:

### FILE: [filename]
Current: [exact quoted text]
Paraphrase: [minimal reworded version]
Why: [which JD requirement/keyword this addresses]

## Chunks Requiring No Change
List filenames that already match the JD well — explicitly confirming
"leave as-is" prevents unnecessary edits.

## GAPS — NO MATCHING CHUNK
JD requirements with no supporting fact in any chunk below, including
any that are structural (not fixable by paraphrase) rather than
presentational. Distinguish the two explicitly if both types appear.
