# Force UTF-8 everywhere. python:3.12-slim often has no UTF-8 locale
# configured, which makes Python's default text encoding (used by
# sys.stdin.read(), open() without encoding=, etc.) fall back to ASCII or
# the container's ambient locale — silently corrupting non-ASCII characters
# (em-dashes, smart quotes) the moment they're read. Setting these env vars
# makes UTF-8 the default for every Python process in the container, so
# individual scripts don't each need to remember to set encoding= everywhere.
